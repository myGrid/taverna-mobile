Taverna-mobile-0.1
==================

Taverna Server Android Client v0.1

I am a newbie of Android development. 

This isn't a quality Android application (yet) and 
it used some open source libraries since modifying the Android framework code really takes time,
but I will try later.

You will probably get your eyes hurt many times looking at the source code.

But it will gets better :-)
